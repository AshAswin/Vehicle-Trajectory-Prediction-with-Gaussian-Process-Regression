# Vehicle Trajectory Prediction with Gaussian Process Regression
The objective of this work is long term prediction of vehicle trajectories with GPs, which can be helpful to avoid collisions in a Connected Vehicle (CV) environment. We use the [Lankershim Boulevard](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/operations/07029/index.cfm) dataset which contains trajectory data of different vehicles. With GPs, motion patterns of vehicles are learnt and used to predict their future trajectories and locations. The vehicles are considered to be in a Connected Vehicle environment and therefore the predicted trajectories are shared among them with an intent to avoid collisions. 

This project is an implementation of:
